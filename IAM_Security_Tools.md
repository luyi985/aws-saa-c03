## IAM Security Tools

### IAM Security Tools

We are nearing the end of the section, but first, let us discuss the types of security tools available in IAM.

- IAM Credentials Report

One such tool is the IAM Credentials Report, which operates at the account level. This report contains all your account's users and the status of their various credentials. We will generate this report now and examine it.

- IAM Access Advisor

The second security tool in IAM is called IAM Access Advisor. This tool functions at the user level and displays the service permissions granted to a user along with the last time those services were accessed. This information is very helpful because it relates to the principle of least privilege.

Using IAM Access Advisor, we can identify which permissions are not used and reduce the permissions a user has to align with the principle of least privilege.

I will see you in the next lecture to demonstrate how to use these security tools.

### Key Takeaways
- IAM provides security tools such as the IAM Credentials Report and IAM Access Advisor.
- The IAM Credentials Report offers an account-level overview of all users and their credential statuses.
- IAM Access Advisor operates at the user level, displaying granted service permissions and their last access times.

These tools assist in enforcing the principle of least privilege by identifying unused permissions for reduction.
